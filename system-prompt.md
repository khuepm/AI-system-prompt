**React.js + Tailwindcss Project**

```
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, install Typescript and this template supports TSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

## Any Youtube Video turn to a Game

```
Build an interactive web app to help users explore the principles of making and maintaining friendships, based on the Kurzgesagt video about friendship. 

SPECIFICATIONS:
1.  The app should present the user with a series of scenarios, each representing a different stage or situation in the process of making and maintaining friendships. Scenarios should be drawn from the video's examples (e.g., attending a class, joining a club, moving to a new city, having a breakup, scrolling through contacts on your phone).

2.  For each scenario, the app should pose a question to the user, prompting them to choose from a set of actions or behaviors.  Actions should be simple, concrete, and reflect either positive or negative friendship-building behaviors discussed in the video.

3.  Each action chosen by the user should result in a visual or numerical representation of the impact on their friendship "score" or "network". This could be a simple bar graph or a network diagram showing connections growing or shrinking.  Positive actions increase the score, negative actions decrease it.

4.  The app should track the user's overall friendship score throughout the scenarios. The user should receive feedback at the end of each scenario, and at the end of the game, based on their final score. This feedback can provide encouragement and tips for improving their friendship skills.

5.  The app should incorporate at least three scenarios, and ideally closer to 5-7. The scenarios should be varied, and should cover both initiating new friendships and maintaining existing ones.

6.  Keep the interface simple and visually appealing. Use colors and imagery that evoke a sense of warmth, connection, and fun, but avoid being overly sentimental or saccharine.

7.  The actions presented should be easily understandable and should clearly relate back to the principles discussed in the video (e.g., prioritizing time, showing genuine interest, being open and receptive, inviting people to do fun things, sharing experiences).

8. The app's logic and scoring mechanism should be transparent, so users understand how their actions impact their friendship network. Avoid arbitrary scoring, and instead focus on rewarding behaviors that are known to build strong relationships.

Provide the code as a single, self-contained HTML document. All styles and scripts must be inline. In the result, encase the code between "```" and "```" for easy parsing.
